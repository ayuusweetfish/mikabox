__Mikabox__ is a modern gaming console from the ground up.

There is a kernel which runs on Raspberry Pi Zero and is emulated on desktop
environments; the Overworld, a bundled main menu application; and a few games
ported and being ported:

- Tetris
- CELESTE Classic
- Cave Story
- VVVVVV
- Oquonie

Mikabox is distinct from other gaming platforms and fantasy computers in that it

- runs directly on a real Raspberry Pi Zero board
- empowers applications with [bare-metal multimedia performance] on the Pi
- accepts applications in the form of normal ELF executables, implying
  possibilities in a wide range of languages and tools
- is open (GPL or the Hippocratic License)

[bare-metal multimedia performance]: #

Setup is a no-brainer, and effort has been put into simplifying application
development for the platform. [Get started](/start/).
